# Shanazam AGI 2.6 (QFree Memory Core Enhanced)  
> **Created by Mohd Shamoon**

Shanazam is a modular Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) prototype that fuses emotional modeling, cultural reasoning, logic synthesis, and ARC-style problem solving using QCB-based logic gates and QFree architecture.

## 🔧 Key Features

✅ **QFreeProcessor Core** — A zero-dependency, memory-efficient AGI kernel  
✅ **ARC Grid Logic Engine** — Solves pattern tasks using abstract rule discovery  
✅ **Emotion + Culture Modulation** — Simulates Ubuntu, Karuna, Harmony, etc.  
✅ **Recursive Self-Reflection** — Meta-thought and value-based reasoning  
✅ **Narrative Generation Engine** — Story generation through cultural arcs  
✅ **PPO-Based RL Planning** — Optimizes actions over a reward/ethics landscape  
✅ **Evaluation Metrics** — BLEU, ROUGE, Logic Accuracy, Trace-Back Memory  
✅ **IP-Protected ID** — Authenticated versioning and ownership
